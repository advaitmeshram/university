# Lab 1 – Introduction to C Programming

This lab was about getting started with basic C coding, using an IDE, and testing simple programs.  
It covered writing, compiling, running, and formatting C programs.

## Tasks

### Task 1 – Hello World
- First C program, printing text to the screen.  
- File: [hello_world.c](hello_world.c)

### Task 2 – Format.c
- Given a file with many `printf` examples.  
- Learned how different format specifiers work (`%d`, `%i`, `%f`, `%c`, `%s`, etc.).  
- File: [format.c](format.c)

### Task 3 – Fahrenheit to Celsius
- Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.  
- Tested with inputs 32 → 0, 95 → 35.  
- Also tried formatting options (`%.1f`, `%.2f`, etc.) and wrong arguments.  
- File: [fahr_to_cels.c](fahr_to_cels.c)

### Task 4 – Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Reverse conversion, from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  
- File: [cels_to_fahr.c](cels_to_fahr.c)

### Task 5 – Basic I/O and Expressions
- (a) Ask for 2 integers → print them and their sum.  
  - [integers_sum.c](basic_io/integers_sum.c)  
- (b) Ask for 2 floats → print them and their product.  
  - [floats_product.c](basic_io/floats_product.c)  
- (c) Ask for a character → print it twice.  
  - [char_twice.c](basic_io/char_twice.c)  
- (d) Try expressions with `a = -a;`, `a -= a;`, `--a;`, `a = (a==a);`.  
  - [var_expressions.c](basic_io/var_expressions.c)

## Notes
- Learned the difference between `%d`, `%f`, `%c`, etc.  
- Practiced with `scanf` and how wrong input types cause errors.  
- Understood `\n` as newline.  
- Saw how assignment and decrement operators work differently.
